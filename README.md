# Analytical Geometry Visualizer

This project provides a small Flask web application to visualize the intersection of a line and a plane. It accepts LaTeX-style input and returns step-by-step calculations along with a generated 3D plot.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask sympy matplotlib antlr4-python3-runtime==4.11
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in a browser and enter your equations.

The interface includes small buttons to help insert LaTeX snippets into the input fields.
